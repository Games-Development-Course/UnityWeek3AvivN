# Unity week 3: Personal Assignment

We were tasked with modifying the game that was developed in the lecture, adding 2 revisions from the list given, and add 2 new original revisions.
I chose to make the following revisions:

1. Top and Bottom collider bounds, Horizontal cyclic behaviour.
2. Score detached from spaceships, and anchored to topright, in relative to the camera.

Original revisions:
1. Automatic fire (Holding down space key) after accumulating 5 points enabled for 5 seconds.
2. TripleShot powerups spawn across the map every 10 seconds, which augment the shooting capacity from 1 vertical laser to add 2 additional diagonal lasers.
